# SONAR Documentation

Welcome to the SONAR project. This toolkit provides audio processing and reconstruction utilities with two core modules:

- SONAR — Real-time spectral analysis and signal reconstruction utilities.
- dSONAR — Data-oriented APIs for deterministic processing and offline analysis.

## Features
- High-performance C modules for audio processing
- Clear header-level APIs in lib/ and mojibake/
- Doxygen-generated documentation with a custom light theme that matches the SONAR icon

## Getting Started
1. Explore the public headers under lib/ and mojibake/ for the API surface.
2. Open the Data Structures and Files sections in the navigation to browse types and functions.
3. Use the search box at the top-right to quickly find symbols.

## Repository Layout
- lib/ — Core audio engine and public headers
- mojibake/ — Main application modules and integration
- html/ — Generated documentation
